# I am Embracing Deep-Work

## How does this affect you?

### Teams
I will be checking my Teams messages hourly, so my responses may be delayed. If your message is time-sensitive/urgent. Please give me a call on Teams. 

### Email
I will be responding to emails in the morning, noon, and COB. 

## Why am I doing this? 
In our modern world, multi-tasking is prevalent, especially with the use of instant messaging and email. **Unfortunately, multi-tasking leads to [attention residue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749597809000399?via%3Dihub)**, similar to how your computer slows down when many programs are open. 

Reducing the amount of context-switching allows our brains to work through complex problems more efficiently by reducing attention residue.

**My hope is that we can collectively work toward single-tasking, enabling us to improve our focus and deliver better solutions to our teams and organizations.**
